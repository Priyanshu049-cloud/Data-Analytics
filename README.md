# Bank Loan Case Study - READ ME
This project involves analyzing loan application data to identify patterns influencing loan default risk, ensuring capable applicants are not rejected while minimizing financial losses. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the key objectives are:

Handling Missing Data: Identify and address missing values using Excel functions (e.g., COUNT, ISBLANK) and appropriate imputation techniques.
Outlier Detection: Detect outliers in numerical variables with Excel statistical functions (e.g., QUARTILE, IQR) and visualize them with box or scatter plots.
Data Imbalance Analysis: Assess class imbalance in target variables using COUNTIF and SUM, with visual representation in pie or bar charts.
Univariate, Segmented, and Bivariate Analysis: Explore variable distributions, segmented insights, and relationships using Excel tools like pivot tables and graphs (e.g., histograms, stacked bar charts).
Top Correlations: Identify key variables correlated with loan default under different scenarios using CORREL and visualize them via heatmaps.
